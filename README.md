# jigsaw game
Jigsaw Game is a gamemode for S&box where you get to collect puzzle pieces and connect them into an image you loaded from the web!
This gamemode is built to support any map made in s&box, just as long as the map has a generated NavMesh.

While this repository is open, I would not recommend using any of the material in here as reference.
Going into this project I had never worked with network code before. As such, the code is a bit of a mess.
