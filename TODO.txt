TODO

- Pick up group from any piece, not just root.
- Add physics to active piece, so that it doesn't move through walls.
- Make sure pieces spawn close to already spawned pieces to prevent pieces spawning way in the distance (max radius thing) (make sure they aren't spawned in a ordered line)
- Viewmodel?
- TK physics and animation

- VC positional
public override void OnVoicePlayed(IClient cl)
{
	cl.Voice.WantsStereo = true;
	base.OnVoicePlayed(cl);
}

- Platform to place pieces into, limit group size outside of platform.
can't pick up correctly placed pieces from the grid
- Limit aspect ratio of valid puzzle image to make max x and y dimensions manageable and reasonable. 10x20/20x10  pieces (1:2 aspect)?
With this limit, platform needs to be 20x20 to accomodate any image. 
(maybe don't limit aspect, and only limit piece count on any axis to be <= 20? In this case, weird aspect ratios would be fine, but the puzzles might be 1x20 pieces...)
