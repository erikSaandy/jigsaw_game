- Viewmodel
- Pickup pieces with physics. Heaver with more pieces. 9+ pieces is heaviest? shouldn't be too annoying to drag across the map. (TK physics and animation)
- Puzzle scene is a no-go. It's just too bad if you acidentally build a group too big to fit through a door for instance.
- Make sure pieces spawn close to already spawned pieces to prevent pieces spawning way in the distance (max radius thing) (make sure they aren't spawned in a ordered line)
- Loading puzzles seems pretty unstable... especially when trying to spawn pieces on the navmesh. fix it you dummy.

-crouching
-IUSE functionality (can't open doors etc)
